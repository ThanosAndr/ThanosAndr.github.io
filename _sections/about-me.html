<p>I'm not only into technologyâ€”I also enjoy working with my hands. Woodworking is my favorite craft, you'll often find me hiking in the countryside or behind a camera, trying to capture the beauty of nature. I adapt quickly to new situations and genuinely enjoy being part of a team where ideas and skills come together.
   Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Klepsydra Technologies AG, a Swiss company specializing in high-performance libraries designed to optimize AI and general-purpose applications on embedded systems, particularly for aerospace and space industries.
