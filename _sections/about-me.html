<p>I describe myself as a tech enthusiast but that's not the whole case. I also love to craft things and wood is my material of choice. I adapt quickly to new situations and respond well working in a team. 
   At the momment, I am a Research Assistant at Circuits & Systems Group of NTUA, where I also conducted my Thesis Project under the supervision of Dr. P.P.Sotiriadis.
