<p>I describe myself as a tech enthusiast but that's not the whole case. I also love to craft things and wood is my material of choice, I enjoy hiking in the countryside and taking photos of beautiful sceneries. I adapt quickly to new situations and respond well working in a team. 
   At the momment, I am working as a Research Associate at Center of Research & Technology Hellas (CERTH) of Thessaloniki.
