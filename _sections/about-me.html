<p>I consider myself a tech enthusiast, but that's just one part of who I am. I have a passion for crafting, with wood being my material of choice. I also enjoy hiking through the countryside and capturing the beauty of nature through photography. I pride myself on adapting quickly to new situations and thriving in collaborative team environments.
   Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Klepsydra Technologies AG, a Swiss company specializing in high-performance libraries designed to optimize AI and general-purpose applications on embedded systems, particularly for aerospace and space industries.
