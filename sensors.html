<p> During the "Sensors & Application" course at NTUA we had to come up with an idea for a project, implement it and make a presentation about it.
 The basic concept is described by the photo above, using an Arduino Yun reads the outside the house temprature from Yahoo weather using a Temboo account and compares it with the inhouse temprature measured from the board.
  If the difference is greater than 10 degrees it turns the AC off, by emmiting the proper IR code from a basic IR emitter, in order to make the change of climate be less stressful to the human body.</p>
