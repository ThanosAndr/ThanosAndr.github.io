<p> During the 'Sensors & Application' course at NTUA, we were tasked with developing a project idea, implementing it, and presenting our results. 
  The concept, as illustrated in the photo above, involved using an Arduino Yun to read the outdoor temperature from Yahoo Weather via a Temboo account and comparing it with the indoor temperature measured by the board.
  If the temperature difference exceeded 10 degrees, the system would turn off the AC by emitting the appropriate IR code through a basic IR emitter. This mechanism was designed to make temperature transitions less stressful on the human body.</p>
