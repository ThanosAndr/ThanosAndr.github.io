<p> As part of the Sensors & Applications course at NTUA, I worked on a project that combined hardware and cloud data. Using an Arduino Yun connected to a Temboo account, the system retrieved outdoor temperature data from Yahoo Weather and compared it with the indoor temperature measured by the board. 
  When the difference exceeded 10°C, the Arduino automatically switched off the air conditioner by sending the appropriate IR signal through a simple emitter. 
  The goal was to ease the body’s adjustment to sudden temperature changes and promote a more comfortable indoor environment.</p>
