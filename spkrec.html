<p>In my diploma thesis, a text-independent speaker recognition system was designed
and implemented. Utilizing a short term spectral characteristic extraction method, the Mel-
Frequency Cepstral Coeffcients (MFCC) which is considered a state-of-the-art method for speech
processing. As a classifer an Artifcial Neural Network (ANN) is used in order to
classify the extracted characteristics. Furthermore, we used a metric utilizing the number of
identifed inputs for each user in order make a decision.</p>
