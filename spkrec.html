<p>My diploma thesis involved the design and implementation of a text-independent speaker recognition system. The system utilized a short-term spectral characteristic extraction method known as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), a state-of-the-art approach in speech processing.
	An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) served as the classifier, responsible for categorizing the extracted characteristics. Additionally, a decision metric was developed, leveraging the number of identified inputs for each user to make accurate decisions.</p>
